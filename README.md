## Welcome to my portfolio!
My name is Felipe Paskevicius, I'm 22 years old and I'm a Data Scientist at one of the largest multinationals in the world. If you've reached me, feel free to make suggestions or comments, they are very important to me.

My aspiration, as a professional and as a person, is to make problems that seem difficult, easier. I believe that the world, people and companies have many problems, my role is to try to help decipher these enigmas and collaborate in this larger puzzle that we are all part of and that I am still trying to understand. Who knows, maybe you can help me with this? Anyway, commit by commit, I'm getting there.

## Projects
Here are all the main projects I have already developed.
